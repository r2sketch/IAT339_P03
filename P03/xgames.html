       <h2>XGAMES</h2>
       <h3>server-sided web application.</h3>
       <h3>fall 2020.</h3>
       <p>
        For SIAT’s third-year internet computing technologies class, we were assigned to create a database-powered website with user management using HTML, CSS, PHP, AJAX, and MySQL. In my team of 3, we created a shopping website that supports product filtering and searching, secure authentication handling, member registration and login, and tracking of orders and products using MySQL database (Figure 1 & 2). One of my main tasks for this project was to design the database that will hold all the incoming user data and outgoing products information, as such I will explain my process with focus on this aspect.
       </p>
       <br><br>
       <h3>understanding the data structure</h3>
        <p> To design the database for the website, I studied the products data provided to me in an Excel sheet carefully to understand what type of data we must store for the products (Figure 3). I also outlined every function of the website concisely prior to fully grasp what sort of tables, columns, and relationship the database needs (Figure 4).</p>

      <h3>ER diagram</h3>
       <p>
        With this information in mind, I began by creating an entity relationship (ER) diagram to show the relationships of each entity set stored in the database (Figure 6). ER diagrams are often used to sketch out the design of a database as a means of visualizing how the information a system produces is related. It was helpful to me to be able to quickly visualize the basic database structure prior to creating it using SQL in MySQL.

      <h3>MySQL database</h3>
       <p>
        While referencing the ER diagram, I then used SQL commands in MySQL to create the database; translating each entity to a table and each attribute as a column for that table (Figure 7). Relationships outlined in the ER diagram were also transferred into the MySQL database, using foreign and reference keys to the main entities’ tables.
       </p>
       <p class="paragraph_padding_top"> As this was my first time creating a server sided web application, I had to revisit the ER diagram and recreate the MySQL database multiple times before finalizing it. Specifically, when it was time to connect the database to the website, we found that the database did not store data in the way I expected to. For example, one of our earlier renditions of the database did not have a separate order details table and only an orders table. With this, the database could not store multiple products in an order placed by a user. However, through studying examples of MySQL databases available online, I was able to create the database as seen in Figure x that is fully functional with the website, storing all the needed data.  </p>
       <p>Overall, this project was successful because not only was it well regarded by the instructing team, but it also allowed me to practice designing and creating databases. </p>
